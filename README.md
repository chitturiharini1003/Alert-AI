🛡️ AlertAI: Community Safety App
AlertAI is a next-generation emergency response system designed to bridge the gap between victims and first responders. By using AI-driven triage, the system automatically dispatches the correct authorities (108 Medical, Fire Services, or Police) while simultaneously alerting a local "Guardian Mesh" of verified citizens.

🚀 Key Features
Dual-State Architecture: A single-app login that identifies the user's role based on context—switching between an SOS Victim View and a Guardian Activity Feed.

Automated AI Triage: The system scans SOS reports for keywords (e.g., "accident", "smoke") to automatically trigger 108 Medical or Fire Department protocols.

Targeted Police Bridge: Allows victims to route emergency data directly to specific local stations like Peddapuram or Surampalem Police Station.

Social Proof Response: The feed displays real-time responder counts (e.g., "12 RESPONDERS") to break the bystander effect and encourage community help.

Gamified Safety Credits: Guardians earn XP and Trust Scores (e.g., 4.9 Trust Score) for verified rescues, creating a sustainable community safety network.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS

Icons: Lucide React

Deployment: Vercel

State Management: React Hooks (useState/useEffect)

📋 How It Works (Presentation Logic)
Incident Detection: A victim triggers an SOS via the Authority Bridge.

AI Classification: The system identifies if the emergency is Medical, Fire, or Personal Safety.

Authority Relay: 108 or Fire services are notified via the System Action Protocol.

Community Deployment: Nearby verified "Guardians" receive the alert on their Live Activity Feed and can respond immediately.
